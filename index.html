<p>Arduino is an open source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. An Arduino board is a tiny computer that has processing capabilities, RAM, memory and input-output pins. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.</p>
